Locating the bootloader is done by following a few conventions which have been in the PC world for decades. In short, BIOS has a configured set of boot devices. This preference is stored in the CMOS. </p> <p>After POST, BIOS will start going through each Boot Device and verify if it has a Master Boot Record. This is where GRUB enters the picture. GRUB is a program residing in the Master Boot Record of a bootable device. </p> <p>Here is a quick anatomy of the Master Boot Record. Its the first sector of a disk. A disk sector is traditionally 512bytes. Modern disks have larger sectors up to 4096 bytes [Advanced Format Disks] but even these disks access the physical media in 512byte emulated mode [512e]</p> <p>512bytes of the MBR are broken up as follows</p> <ul> <li>1-446bytes - Bootloader code. Grub boot.img</li> <li>64 bytes - Master Partition Entries, Up to 4 entries, 16 bytes each. </li> <li>Last 2bytes - A special magic number 0xAA55. This indicates to the BIOS, there is a bootloader on this disk device. </li> </ul> <p>With that out of the way, lets look at GRUB as a bootloader. </p> <p>Now. lets be honest. 512bytes is a tight space, and adding things like splash image, nice graphics and menus to dual boot an OS will take way more than 512bytes. For eg. EasyBMP a tiny library to display images on screen when statically linked is 20kb! </p> <p>To work around this limitation, Grub does a multi-stage boot. Stage 1: Boot.img, Fits in 440byte MBR. Its a simple sled program which loads Stage 1.5 using a LBA address jump Stage 1.5: Core.img, Fits in 32kb. It has just enough file system modules to load \\/boot\\/grub. Stage 2: \\/boot\\/grub is a special folder in /boot partition or a path on the root / partition. This is where all grub modules are available. It contains module drives for a large set of IO devices including networking booting. It also brings some nice things like a GUI, selection menus and splash pages!</p> <p></p> <p>Now all that theory out of the way, how do we boot the kernel itself? We usually just select a menu and boom! Linux starts loading up? Well, there is a bunch of configuration files and menu entries which makes that happen. Just peek into <code>/boot/grub/grub.cfg</code>. But we aren't looking at GRUB and its magic. Lets try to boot a system by first principles. </p> <p>Here is the minimal set of commands you can use on a GRUB prompt to start a Linux system. </p> <pre><code>insmod linux\nset root=(hd0,1)\nlinux /boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-29-generic root=/dev/sda1\ninitrd /boot/initrd.img-3.13.0-29-generic\nboot\n</code></pre> <p>A quick description of what's happening. </p> <ul> <li>Load the linux grub module. This module tells grub how to start a Linux like operating system. </li> <li><code>hd0,1</code> - This is the tricky bit! This is grub's way of selecting a hard drive partition. varies on each machine, depending on how it was partitioned. This stackexchange discussion should come in handy</li> <li><code>/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-29-generic</code> is the compressed compiled linux kernel. Tab completion is your friend.

Phew! </p> <p>Future Topics If you're interested, I can cover BIOS and bootloader in more detail in future posts.

What the heck is a Terminal/Shell/TTY?","text":"<p>Long ago, in the early days of computing, when machines were vast and mysterious entities hidden behind layers of complexity, the world of Unix was emerging. It was a time when interactions with these computing behemoths were facilitated by peculiar devices known as terminals.</p> <p></p> <p>Picture this: a teleprinter-style contraption resembling a typewriter, affectionately referred to as a \"teletypewriter\" or simply a \"tty.\" These were the portals through which users communicated with the mighty computers. But what was a terminal, really? Etymologically speaking, a terminal was at the end of an electric wire, forming a connection between humans and machines.</p> <p>In the Unix realm, terms like terminal, tty, console, and shell danced intricately in a linguistic ballet. Terminal and tty were once synonymous, representing the text input/output environment. Meanwhile, the console, from a furniture perspective, stood as the physical terminal, the primary link to the machine.</p> <p>As time marched forward, the electronic keyboards and displays became the new norm for terminals. The tty transformed into a specific kind of device file, extending beyond mere read and write commands. Some ttys were born from the kernel, others from terminal emulators like Xterm, Screen, SSH, and Expect.</p> <p></p> <p>The word \"terminal\" also took on a traditional meaning\u2014a device where users interacted with a computer using a keyboard and display. Enter the X terminal, a thin client dedicated solely to human-computer interaction, with applications running on a more potent computer.</p> <p>As the wheels of time went by, terminals started bridging effortlessly larger communication chasm. What started off as same room terminals, soon covered buildings, then grew to campus level machines, and slowly piggy backed on the parallelly influential telecommunications network to enable terminals across miles. </p> <p></p> <p>But what about the console? It wasn't just any terminal; it was the primary one directly connected to the machine. In some systems, like Linux and FreeBSD, the console manifested as several ttys, adding a layer of confusion with names like \"console,\" \"virtual console,\" and \"virtual terminal.\"</p> <p>And then there was the shell\u2014a guiding force, the user's interface upon logging in. Was it the home environment for the user, or the realm where other programs dwelled? The mystery lingered.</p> <p>Unix, being a diverse universe, birthed numerous shells. Bash, Zsh, and fish each brought their unique flavors to the interactive shell scene. Command-line shells allowed users to string together commands, often following the Bourne shell syntax. We had also entered the era of tele-communicaiton. teletypewriters had come a long way. </p> <p></p> <p>As the dust settled, in the intricate dance between the terminal and the shell, tasks were divided. The terminal converted keys into control sequences, while the shell turned these sequences into executable commands. Line editing, input history, and completion were the domains of the shell.</p> <p>Output, on the other hand, belonged to the shell. Instructions like \"display foo,\" \"switch foreground color to green,\" and \"move cursor to the next line\" emanated from the shell, guiding the terminal's actions.</p> <p>As users traversed this digital landscape, copy-pasting and job control became part of their routine. The terminal facilitated inter-application copy-paste, while the shell managed job control, orchestrating programs in the background.</p> <p>Thus, the history of terminals, consoles, and shells unfolded\u2014a tale of technological evolution, linguistic intricacies, and the symbiotic dance between humans and machines in the Unix cosmos.</p>","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"Articles/Bits-n-bytes/Ghost%20in%20a%20shell%20-%20What%20the%20heck%20is%20a%20Terminal%2CShell%20and%20TTY/#illustrate-the-problem","title":"Illustrate the problem","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"Articles/Bits-n-bytes/Ghost%20in%20a%20shell%20-%20What%20the%20heck%20is%20a%20Terminal%2CShell%20and%20TTY/#talk-about-the-core-idea-of-the-solution","title":"Talk about the Core Idea of the Solution","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"Articles/Bits-n-bytes/Ghost%20in%20a%20shell%20-%20What%20the%20heck%20is%20a%20Terminal%2CShell%20and%20TTY/#evidence-about-the-solution-approach","title":"Evidence about the Solution Approach","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"Articles/Bits-n-bytes/Ghost%20in%20a%20shell%20-%20What%20the%20heck%20is%20a%20Terminal%2CShell%20and%20TTY/#solution-playbook","title":"Solution Playbook","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"Articles/Bits-n-bytes/Ghost%20in%20a%20shell%20-%20What%20the%20heck%20is%20a%20Terminal%2CShell%20and%20TTY/#call-to-action","title":"Call to Action","text":"","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"Articles/Bits-n-bytes/Ghost%20in%20a%20shell%20-%20What%20the%20heck%20is%20a%20Terminal%2CShell%20and%20TTY/#footnotes","title":"Footnotes","text":"<ul> <li>What is the exact difference between a 'terminal', a 'shell', a 'tty' and a 'console'? - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</li> <li>The TTY demystified</li> <li>Linux TTY Shell Cheat Sheet - Steflan's Security Blog</li> <li>Upgrading Simple Shells to Fully Interactive TTYs - ropnop blog</li> <li>socat</li> <li>Unix Shells and Terminals - by Erik Engheim - Erik Explores</li> </ul>","tags":["topic/platform-engineering","topic/devops","topic/deep-dives","series/bits-n-bytes"]},{"location":"Articles/Draft/ContextSwitching/","title":"Real Cost of Context Switching","text":"<p>Media</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Articles/Draft/Django%20FK%20with%20UUID%20vs%20to_field/","title":"Django FK with UUID vs to_field","text":"<p>Using a GUID primary key field as a Django Foreign Key vs. using a ForeignKey with <code>to_field</code> pointing to a string unique indexed field has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here's a comparison of the two approaches in the context of Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF), with a focus on database performance, migrations, and operations/maintenance:</p> Aspect GUID Primary Key String Unique Indexed Field Database Performance Pros: Pros: - Global uniqueness - Potentially faster joins - No need to create indexes - Smaller index size - Slightly faster queries Cons: Cons: - Larger index size - Increased storage usage - Slightly slower joins Migrations Pros: Pros: - No additional setup - Simpler, human readable setup for unique constraints for unique constraints Cons: Cons: - Potential for migration - Potential for migration issues due to GUIDs issues if the field and foreign keys data is changed Operations/Maintenance Pros: Pros: - Easy to understand - Simplicity in data model and work with and constraints - easier to spot relations and fk's in isolated table dumps Cons: Cons: - Slightly more complex - Extra data model and queries unique field due to GUIDs <p>In summary, using a GUID primary key as a Foreign Key can provide global uniqueness, but it may lead to larger index sizes and slightly slower query performance.  Using GUIDs also compromises insert performance because UUIds are necessarily random, and hence compromise the key-write locality, leading to more random disk writes and more segment fields opened.  If you insist on using UUIDs, prefer using lextime_uuid  which is a time-ordered variant of the UUID.  which preserves locality w.r.t  time of creation and still offers GUID semantics. </p> <p>On the other hand, using a ForeignKey with <code>to_field</code> pointing to a string unique indexed field can result in more compact indexes and potentially faster query performance, but it introduces an additional unique field dependency.</p> <p>The choice between these two options should depend on your specific use case and priorities. If global uniqueness and ease of understanding are more important, you may opt for GUID primary keys. If database performance and simplicity in your data model are critical, using a string unique indexed field with a ForeignKey may be the better choice</p>"},{"location":"Articles/Draft/Langchain%20%2B%20ChatGPT/","title":"Langchain + ChatGPT","text":""},{"location":"Articles/Draft/Langchain%20%2B%20ChatGPT/#before-we-begin","title":"Before we begin","text":"<pre><code>python -V\nmkdir pdf-chatbot cd pdf-chatbot\npython -m venv env\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install langchain openai chromadb pymupdf tiktoken\n</code></pre> <p>A demo on how to build presentations using Slides. <pre><code>import os\nfrom langchain.document_loaders import PyMuPDFLoader\n\nos.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'ENTER YOUR API KEY'\n\nloader = PyMuPDFLoader(\"./docs/example.pdf\")\ndocuments = loader.load()\n</code></pre></p>"},{"location":"Articles/Draft/Langchain%20%2B%20ChatGPT/#formatting","title":"Formatting","text":"<p>You can use regular Markdown formatting, like emphasized and bold text. 1.

But trust me, it's the backbone of everything we do. Understanding how the Linux kernel handles networking isn't just about impressing your colleagues\u2014it's about making your life easier.</p> <p>Imagine being able to diagnose network issues faster, optimize performance right up to the wire, and build rock-solid, scalable architectures with confidence. That's the power of firsts principle learning. This series will aim to bring hands on first principles for a small part of the Linux kernel stack. </p> <p>I also have an ulterior motive. I want to make sure you get a friendly tour of a small relatable part of the Linux kernel so that you aren't afraid to look further, on your own, with confidence. Shadow learning as Randy Pausch would call it.  I wish to ignite a small match, which makes you wonder, Now that I know how Networking works, I wonder how my GPU works? or my NVME?  I hope this curiosity, coupled with some tips and tricks you learn throughout, would fuel the Engineers to look around and gain depth. </p> <p>So, whether you're a seasoned pro looking to level up your skills or a newbie eager to dive into the deep end, this series has something for you.

Once, he was meditating in the forest. Along came some travellers, hotly pursued by bandits. There was a fork in the path, precisely at the spot where he was seated, meditating. The travellers requested Kaushika not to tell the bandits which branch they had taken. Having taken a vow of speaking only the truth, Kaushika would do no such thing. He told the bandits the truth. The bandits fell upon the travellers and killed them. Consequently, Kaushika was punished by being sent to hell. There are other instances in the Mahabharata where lying served a greater common good. \u2014 location: 1105^ref-43102</p> <p>six kinds of taste or flavour (rasa): sweet (madhura), salty (lavana), pungent (katu), bitter (tikta), sour (amla) and astringent (kashaya). All \u2014 location: 1132^ref-10210</p> <p>It certainly does not suggest that you should be a vegetarian, or that you should only eat certain kinds of meat. Food habits depend on history and on agro-climatic zones and geography. \u2014 location: 1136^ref-41736</p> <p>In the Mahabharata, there is a longish section known as Shanti Parva, when Bhishma is lying down on his bed of arrows and instructing Yudhishthira. Within that, there is a sub-section about apad dharma, the dharma in the time of calamities. I will tell you the story briefly. \u2014 location: 1148^ref-17678</p> <p>As I have told you earlier, the word muni is etymologically linked to silence. Munis maintained silence. I haven\u2019t come across any instances of munis marrying and having children. \u2014 location: 1153^ref-53696</p> <p>shvapakas were. They weren\u2019t quite chandalas, though the two terms are sometimes used synonymously. Shvapakas kept dogs and also ate dogs. \u2014 location: 1156^ref-58954</p> <p>If you eat meat, you should not eat dog-meat. Brahmanas and kshatriyas should only eat the five different kinds of animals that have five claws.27 \u2014 location: 1164^ref-4851</p> <p>\u2018My first priority is to remain alive. One can follow dharma only if one remains alive. I know dharma better than you do. I know that the body and the atman are distinct. The body is eating the meat, not the atman. Therefore, the atman will not be polluted and will commit no sin.\u2019 \u2014 location: 1169^ref-57889</p> <p>A wealthy person invited everyone to a dinner reception. Since Mullah Nasruddin didn\u2019t have time to change, he turned up in his torn clothes. He was treated shabbily and no one gave him food. Therefore, he went home and changed. When he turned up, attired in his fine coat, everyone welcomed him and gave him the best of food. Mullah Nasruddin started to feed his coat, \u2018Eat, fur coat! Eat.\u2019 When people asked him about his strange behaviour, Nasruddin responded, \u2018I wasn\u2019t welcome at the feast, but my coat was. \u2014 location: 1229^ref-39059</p> <p>These shlokas, 1.26 to 1.27 and 1.32 to 1.34, are spoken by Arjuna and provide the setting for the entire Bhagavad Gita, \u2014 location: 1245^ref-37852</p> <p>The expression \u2018kith and kin\u2019 is rarely used now. Kith means friends, kin means relatives. \u2014 location: 1270^ref-18779</p> <p>\u2018As long as man is capable of earning wealth, his family members are attached to him. But later, when his body has aged, even if he remains alive, no one at home asks about his welfare.\u2019 \u2014 location: 1273^ref-54294</p> <p>\u2018As long as there is a breath of life in the body, those at home ask about his welfare. However, when the breath of life leaves the body, even his wife is terrified of his body [dead body]. \u2014 location:

The Wyse WY-370introduced new color modes, including a direct-indexed 64-color palette. (See Page 86 of its Programmer\u2019s Guide.)</li> <li>38 and 48 are the most important parameters for selecting colors today, but they weren\u2019t allocated by either the4th(1986) or5th(1991) editions. So where did they come from? The 5th edition gives a clue:   <p>reserved for future standardization; intended for setting character foreground colour as specified in ISO 8613-6 [CCITT Recommendation T.416]</p> </li> <li>ISO 8613 was a boondoggle of a project intended to standardize and replace all proprietary document file formats. You\u2019ve never heard of it, so it obviously failed. But its legacy lives on \u2013 ISO 8613-6 (ITU T.416) (1993) built on ECMA-48\u2019s codes and defined parameters 38 and 48 as extended foreground and background color modes, respectively.   <p>The first parameter element indicates a choice between:  </p> <ul> <li>0 implementation defined (only applicable for the character foreground colour)  </li> <li>1 transparent;  </li> <li>2 direct colour in RGB space;  </li> <li>3 direct colour in CMY space;  </li> <li>4 direct colour in CMYK space;  </li> <li>5 indexed colour.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>There we go! That is why 5 is used for 256-color mode and 2 is 24-bit RGB.</p> <p>Careful reading also gives a clue as to the semicolon vs. colon syntax screw-up. Note the subtle use of the term \u201cparameter element\u201d vs. \u201cparameter\u201d.</p> <p>If you read ISO 8613-6 (ITU T.416) and ECMA-48 closely, it\u2019s not explicitly stated, but they seem to indicate that unknown parameters for commands like \u201cselect graphics rendition\u201d should be ignored. And parameters are separated with semicolons.</p> <p>That implies <code>ESC[38;5;3m</code> should be interpreted, in terminals that don\u2019t support SGR 38, as \u201cunknown, ignored (38)\u201d, \u201cblinking (5)\u201d, and \u201citalicized (3)\u201d. The syntax should use colons to separate sub-parameter components, but something got lost along the way.</p> <p>(Now, in practice, programs are told how to communicate with their terminals via the TERM variable and the terminfo database, so I don\u2019t know how much pain occurs in reality.)</p> <p>Thomas Dickey has done a great job documenting the history ofncurses andxterm, and, lo and behold, explains exactly the origin of the ambiguous syntax:</p> <p>We used semicolon (like other SGR parameters) for separating the R/G/B values in the escape sequence, since a copy of ITU T.416 (ISO-8613-6) which presumably clarified the use of colon for this feature was costly.</p> <p>Using semicolon was incorrect because some applications could expect their parameters to be order-independent. As used for the R/G/B values, that was order-dependent. The relevant information, by the way, is part of ECMA-48 (not ITU T.416, as mentioned in Why only 16 (or 256) colors?). Quoting from section 5.4.2 of ECMA-48, page 12, and adding emphasis (not in the standard):</p> <p>Each parameter sub-string consists of one or more bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/10; the bit combinations from 03/00 to 03/09 represent the digits ZERO to NINE; bit combination 03/10 may be used as a separator in a parameter sub-string, for example, to separate the fractional part of a decimal number from the integer part of that number.</p> <p>and later on page 78, in 8.3.117 SGR \u2013 SELECT GRAPHIC RENDITION, the description of SGR 38:</p> <p>(reserved for future standardization; intended for setting character foreground colour as specified in ISO 8613-6 [CCITT Recommendation T.416])</p> <p>Of course you will immediately recognize that 03/10 is ASCII colon, and that ISO 8613-6 necessarily refers to the encoding in a parameter sub-string. Or perhaps you will not.</p> <p>So it\u2019s all because the ANSI and ISO standards are ridiculously expensive (to this day, these crappy PDF scans from the 90s and earlier are $200 USD!) and because they use a baroque syntax to denote ASCII characters. While writing this post, I had to keep <code>man ascii</code>open to match, for example, <code>03/10</code> to colon and <code>03/11</code> to semicolon. I guess it\u2019s how standards were written back then.

We\u2019ll decode that next.</li> </ul> <p>Here\u2019s where Terminfo\u2019s limitations cause us trouble. Terminfo and ncurses are tied at the hip. Their programming model is that there are N palette entries, each of which has a default RGB value, and terminals may support overriding any palette entry\u2019s RGB value.</p> <p>The <code>-direct</code> terminals, however, are different. They represent 24-bit colors by pretending there are 16.7 million palette entries, each of which maps to the 8:8:8 RGB cube, but whose values cannot be changed.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s look at the new <code>setaf</code>:</p> <pre><code>print \"\\E[\"\nif p1 &lt; 8 {\n  print \"3\" p1\n} else {\n  print \"38:2::\" (p1 / 65536) \":\" ((p1 / 256) &amp; 255) \":\" (p1 &amp; 255)\n}\nprint \"m\"\n</code></pre> <p>It\u2019s not quite as simple as direct RGB. For compatibility with programs that assume the meaning of <code>setaf</code>, this scheme steals the darkest 7 blues, not including black, and uses them for compatibility with the basic ANSI 8 colors. Otherwise, there\u2019s a risk of legacy programs outputting barely-visible dark blues instead of the ANSI colors they expect.</p> <p>One consequence is that the <code>-direct</code> schemes are incompatible with the <code>-256color</code> schemes, so programs must be aware that 256 colors means indexed and 16.7 million means direct, except that the darkest 7 blues are to be avoided.</p> <p>Fundamentally, terminfo has no notion of color space. So a program that was written before terminfo even supported more colors than 256 might (validly!) assume the values of the first 8, 16, or even 256 palette entries.</p> <p>This explains an issue with the Rust cratetermwiz that I recently ran into at work. Aprogram expected to output colors in the xterm-256color palette, but was actually generating various illegibly-dark shades of blue. (Note: Despite the fact that the issue is open as of this writing, @quark-zju landed a fix, so current termwiz behaves reasonably.)</p> <p>This is a terminfo restriction, not a terminal restriction. As far as I know, every terminal that supports 24-bit color also supports the xterm 256-color palette and even dynamically changing their RGB values. (You can even animate the palettelike The Secret of Monkey Island did!)
