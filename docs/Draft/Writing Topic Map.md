We will now decide what are the topics which we will want to write over the next week. So, let us begin with deciding different days and what that day would cover. Tuesday is usually the beginning of the week, I think we would want to write about technology and like deep tech articles on Tuesday. Thursday is where we will go into leadership and career coaching. Friday and Saturday should be more about future looking directions of technology, something to do with you know how technology is evolving, security space, cyber security and geopolitics and in general and Sunday could be just philosophy.
