# Django FK with UUID vs to_field

Using a GUID primary key field as a Django Foreign Key vs. using a ForeignKey with `to_field` pointing to a string unique indexed field has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Here's a comparison of the two approaches in the context of Django and Django Rest Framework (DRF), with a focus on database performance, migrations, and operations/maintenance:


| Aspect                 | GUID Primary Key            | String Unique Indexed Field     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |

|                        | - Global uniqueness         | - Potentially faster joins      |
|                        | - No need to create indexes | - Smaller index size            |
|                        |                             | - Slightly faster queries       |

|                        |                             |                                 |
| Migrations             | **Pros:**                   | **Pros:**                       |

|                        | **Cons:**                   | **Cons:**                       |
|                        | - Potential for migration   | - Potential for migration       |

|                        |                             |                                 |

In summary, using a GUID primary key as a Foreign Key can provide global uniqueness, but it may lead to larger index sizes and slightly slower query performance. 
Using GUIDs also compromises insert performance because UUIds are necessarily random, and hence compromise the key-write locality, leading to more random disk writes and more segment fields opened.  If you insist on using UUIDs, prefer using lextime_uuid  which is a time-ordered variant of the UUID.  which preserves locality w.r.t  time of creation and still offers GUID semantics. 

On the other hand, using a ForeignKey with `to_field` pointing to a string unique indexed field can result in more compact indexes and potentially faster query performance, but it introduces an additional unique field dependency.

The choice between these two options should depend on your specific use case and priorities. If global uniqueness and ease of understanding are more important, you may opt for GUID primary keys. If database performance and simplicity in your data model are critical, using a string unique indexed field with a ForeignKey may be the better choice
