Physical Memory and Single Address Space
- Simple and no abstractions in between
- Portable programs aren't easy
- Low security. pure chaos


Virtual Memory
 - Swap
 - Multi tasking and Context Switching
 - Memory Mapping
 - Secured Access at Hardware level

MMU and TLB
- Memory Management Unit and its Hardware implementation
- Translation Lookaside buffer.
