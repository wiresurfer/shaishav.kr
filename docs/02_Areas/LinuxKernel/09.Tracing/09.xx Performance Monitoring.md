Tools Ecosystem
 - perf
 - eBPF tools
 - perf-tools
 - bcc
 - bpftrace
 - [GitHub - Netflix/flamescope: FlameScope is a visualization tool for exploring different time ranges as Flame Graphs.](https://github.com/Netflix/flamescope)
	- Sleep(1) vs High Performance Times.   Horizontal Line vs Diagonal Line

CPU Performance
- PMC - Performance Monitoring Counters; 100+ PMCs. 
	- One area is absence of PMC on cloud instances.
	- EC2 m4.16xL xen machines expose 7-9 PMCs
- Use PMCs to correctly identify - Idle, Running and (new) Stalled! 
	- Stalled is a problem which has cropped up in latest processors as they are starved on Memory
	- IPC - Intstructions per cycle
		- We can measure IPC using PMC
		- IPC < 0.2   bad. means we are stalled on memory. 
		- IPC > 2.0   good. 
### Networking Issue
1. `bcc/tcplife`

### Disk Performance Issues. 
1. `iostat`
2. `iolatency`

> Typical Histogram latency for a 7200rpm HDD 
> + 0 - 1ms   -> Cache Hits
> + 8 - 16ms  -> Cache Miss

3. `iosnoop`  and newer `biosnoop` the eBPF-io-snoop
