# 06.02 Kernel High Performance Networking

[Network Performance in the Linux Kernel, Getting the most out of the Hardware - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4w3ydS62S0)

Packet Processing. 
- Single CPU getting interrupts. 

N Tuple Flow
- 2 tuple flows.  for L2/L3 traffic
- 5 tuple flows. for application flows. 

Receive Packet Steering 
- software only optimization. 
- soft-irq CPU core  schedules processing of sk_buff on other cores. 

Receive Side Scaling
- Hardware version of RPS
	- n-tuple RSS id is computed in hardware
	- RSS table defined in driver or via sysfs/ethtool  to define how packets are spread across cores. 
	- can speed up  packet forwarding 3x!  used for openwrt and friends. 

Receive Flow Steering
- RSS/RPS dont care about which cpu-core runs the consuming userspace process.
- kernel maintains an RFS steering table within the kernel .
- Updated dynamically by the kernel
- Software only solution. 

aRFS
- accelerated RFS. 
- Hardware solution. 
- kernel needs to be compiled with `CONFIG_RFS_ACCEL`
	- Driver + HW  needed which can support n-tuple filtering. 
- Manual steering can be optionally configured using `tc flower`, `ethtool`
