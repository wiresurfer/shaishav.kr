# Future of Organizations - Post GenAI Outlook and Trends

A common conversation I have with Startups and Big Corp leaders alike is, how
would the world evolve with GenAI. These conversations have slightly different
trajectories depending on whether the leader is a technical person or a
product/biz person. While there is a lot of material out there, I have noticed a
BS scale evolving.

<!-- more -->

-   for tech leaders by tech folks - Low to Medium BS.
-   for tech leaders by non-tech folks - Shallow, Medium to High BS
-   For non-tech leaders by tech leaders - Over promises by Low BS
-   For non-tech leaders by non-tech leaders - BS^infinity

This article is my contribution to the pile of BS already there. Where I hope to
not be as bad a bullshit artist, and drop some truth bombs. Ambitious right?
lets get on with it then..

Now, before you dismiss this as just another AI hype piece, let me assure you -
I've been in the trenches of machine learning since early-2009. I've seen the AI
winter, the spring of deep learning, and now the summer of GenAI. So, when I say
I'm about to drop some truth bombs, I mean I'm bringing over a decade of battle
scars and hard-earned wisdom to this conversation.

Let's start by acknowledging the elephant in the room: GenAI is not a magic
wand. It's not going to solve all your problems, make your coffee, or turn your
startup into the next unicorn overnight. But it's also not just a fad that we
can afford to ignore. The reality, as always, lies somewhere in the messy
middle.

In this post, we're going to cut through the noise and get to the heart of what
GenAI really means for organizations. We'll explore:

1. The real capabilities of GenAI - what it can do, what it can't, and what it
   might be able to do soon.
2. How to spot AI snake oil salesmen (trust me, they're everywhere).
3. The organizational changes you need to consider to truly leverage GenAI.
4. Some potentially game-changing applications of GenAI that aren't getting
   enough attention.

So, whether you're a tech leader trying to separate hype from reality, or a
business leader trying to understand if you should be investing in this
technology, buckle up. We're about to embark on a BS-free journey through the
land of GenAI.

And remember, while I promise to keep the BS to a minimum, I'm also here to
challenge your thinking. Some of what I say might contradict what you've heard
elsewhere. Good. That's the point. By the end of this post, I want you to have a
clearer, more nuanced understanding of GenAI and its potential impact on your
organization.

Ready? Let's dive in.

## I. GenAI: The Good, the Bad, and the Utterly Ridiculous

Before we make prophecies for the future, it makes sense to understand what has
changed with Gen AI. We know the tell tale party tricks of an LLM application,
we are also becoming aware of its incoming multi-modal skills.

But to me, the proverbial bulb which has been lit is as follows: All AI before
ChatGPT was looking at our world through a numerical/mathematical lens. It would
take a problem statement, expect the human to parse any set of inputs into a
tensor format, and then it would apply some mathematical transform.

In a way, pre GenAI, everything was a mathematical transform from a fixed tensor
space to another tensor space.

Gen, in generative AI was the tipping point. AI could generate sequences before
too. take an LSTM, or a simple ARIMA model. But those were just statistical
extrapolations. All AI was a clever Mathmatical trickster at best.

Its only when Transformers came into play, and parameter space started to grow,
we started seeing glimses of "generative" capabilities.

An anecdote from the domain of Natural Language Processing comes to mind. We
would have a hard time parsing documents and respresenting them using clever,
domain specific vector models. A subfield called feature engineering was the
buzz back in early 2010s. It was an accepted norm that computers don't
understand words or phrases, just vectors and cosine similarity. Word2vec
changes this conception a bit by showing how good a large parameter trained
vector embedding would be. And whem we started framing the problem as "given a
sequence of tokens, predict the next word", we forced models to learn long,
medium and short term relationships between each token. Its still a mystery and
a raging debate whether human knowledge is just a set of token, phrase and
document level weights afterall.

Anyways, this long winded explanation was building up to a singular point. We
need to remember what made GenAI a game changers. It understands the nuances of
tokens, and through it, the nuances of language. It doesn't know truth from
falsehood, correct from wrong, good from evil, smart from dumb. Its just knows
how to bluff its way to the next token.

So, what is this skill good for?

GenAI is an excellent language parser. It can ingest faster than humans,
understand what it reads, link it to what it has read and use its knowledgebase
to answer questions.

This parsing capability makes it great for applications where you asking it to
make sense of the world and then answer questions about the world.

Non-exhaustively, _Parsing_ can mean reading, expanding, rephrasing, format
conversions, structuring, or translation. Similarly _Answer_ questions can mean
organize, expand, reduce, infer intent, classify or review.

## II. GenAI: The Good, the Bad, and the Utterly Ridiculous

Before we dive into future prophecies, let's take a moment to understand what
exactly has changed with the advent of Generative AI. We're all familiar with
the party tricks of LLM applications and their emerging multi-modal skills, but
the real paradigm shift goes deeper.

### A. The Tipping Point: From Mathematical Transforms to Language Understanding

Pre-GenAI, artificial intelligence viewed our world through a purely
mathematical lens. It would take a problem statement, expect humans to parse
inputs into tensor format, and then apply some statistical mathematical
transform. Essentially, everything was a clever mathematical trick, transforming
data from one fixed tensor space to another.

The "Gen" in Generative AI marks a critical tipping point. While AI could
generate sequences before (think LSTM or ARIMA models), these were merely
statistical extrapolations. The game-changer came with Transformers and the
exponential growth in parameter space, giving us the first glimpses of true
"generative" capabilities. These are still, at their core, some form of
statistical models but the parameter space is so huge it stops making sense to a
human at a statistical level.

### B. The Evolution of Natural Language Processing

An anecdote from NLP illustrates this shift perfectly. In the early 2010s, we
struggled with parsing documents and representing them using domain-specific
vector models. Bigram and Trigram models were defacto parsing methods and
further feature engineering was the buzzword. It was accepted that computers
don't understand words or phrases, just vectors and cosine similarity and domain
specific tinkering was absolutely necessary to get the best out of any models.
In a way, each model was trained for a specific problem, with its own specific
features.

Word2vec began to change this conception by demonstrating the power of large
parameter-trained vector embeddings. When we started framing the problem as
"given a sequence of tokens, predict the next word," we forced models to learn
long, medium, and short-term relationships between tokens. Whether human
knowledge is just a set of token, phrase, and document-level weights remains a
fascinating debate.

Its only when we started training transformer models of sufficiently large
parameter space, did we relaize the marvels of transfer learning. Transfer
learning is when you train a model on a particular problem, but can use the
weights learned by the model on a related problem with minimal retraining.
Transfer learning results was the first signs that large transformer models
"knew" about language. It was only a matter of time till these methods were
scaled up with corporate truckloads of money spent in data acquisition and
training. Which brings us to our current post ChatGPT era.

> transcription models gave it hearing and listening capabilities

### C. The Core Capability: Understanding Token Nuances

The key takeaway is this: GenAI understands the nuances of tokens, and through
them, the nuances of language. It doesn't inherently know truth from falsehood,
correct from wrong, or good from evil. It simply knows how to predict the next
most likely token based on its training.

Its akin to a human who knows langauge reading and comprehension at a mind
boggling rate, but missed any training in science, mathematics and ethics. It
does know about history and current affairs, much like how someone who has read
a lot of books would. It doesn't have perfect recollection, so it can make
mistakes.

And worst of all, it still has a computer program's heart, which is, you need to
instruct it very precisely to get what you want. Any minor changes to the way
you instruct will bring swings in the quality of the output. It also has a tough
time retaining context. Humans can keep track of the current conversation, what
they talked with their family over the last week and their memories from college
and use all of these memories in a single conversation without a niggle. GenAI
doesn't have this superior memory model and so, its often the case that you've
got to repeat things in your prompts just to that your GenAI side kick remembers
what you talked about.

So, with this small primer on what it can and cannot do well, lets ask the
following question.

### D. What is GenAI good for TODAY?

In short, genAI today has **Superior Language Parsing** Additionally, an aspect
we haven't talked about is merging this language capability with its image
generation capabilities.

GenAI can ingest information faster than humans, understand what it reads, link
it to its existing knowledge base, and use this to answer questions. GenAI can
also structure its output in multiple formats with ease. This includes both
human and program friendly formats which comes in handy when using the output of
GenAI LLMs in function calling input or as input to other traditional programs.

As we move forward, it's crucial to remember that GenAI, while revolutionary, is
a tool with specific strengths and limitations. Its ability to parse and
generate language-based content is unprecedented, but it's not a magical
solution to all problems. Understanding these capabilities and limitations is
key to leveraging GenAI effectively in organizational contexts.

```

I like to break this Language Understanding into two parts.

1. **Versatile Parsing Applications**: This parsing capability makes it
   excellent for applications where you're asking it to make sense of the world
   and then answer questions about it. Parsing can involve:

    - Reading
    - Expanding
    - Rephrasing
    - Format conversions
    - Structuring
    - Translation

2. **Diverse Question Answering**: The "answering questions" aspect can include:
    - Organizing information
    - Expanding on topics
    - Reducing complexity
    - Inferring intent
    - Classification
    - Reviewing content

In more esoteric use cases you can consider Diverse Question Answering to
include answering with an Image, or a prompt which can be used with another LLM.

Here in lies the first insight.

> ðŸ’¡ Insight 1: If you want to build or buy an AI solution, can you clearly
> frame what the input would be, how would it be parsed by and human, and what

> diagram before build a backend API system.

Please dont ask AI to comeup with ingenious, correct and original thought. It
can spitball something but like we say in C/C++,this is undefined behaviour.

Most common applications can be modelled as follows

-   Write a blog post for me about Topic X --> parse my intended topic, output
    topic X,intent expant. answer: expand(topic X)
-   Read a pdf and answer a question --> parse: intent = question answering,
    question =user's question. content=parsed PDF text. answer: hopefully an
    answer.
-   Generate an image from a prompt --> parse: intent = image generation,
    description = user's input, answer: an image prompt, or if the output layer
    is an image generation layer, then this image prompt is fed directly to a
    transformer which understands images.

> ðŸ’¡ Insight 2: GenAI LLMs are universal functions. A one size fits many
> function call which changes its behaviour depending on the input it gets.

<!-- To simplify our discussion, lets take a concrete GenAI usecase and subject it to -->
<!-- our analysis. -->

<!-- With a clear scope of input and output and an understanding of what parsing and -->
<!-- answering phase would look like, we need to move to feasibility and limitations. -->

but it's not infallible. The most effective use of GenAI comes from combining
its capabilities with human expertise and judgment.

As we continue to explore and expand the applications of GenAI, we're likely to
see even more innovative uses across various sectors. The key is to approach
these tools with a clear understanding of their strengths and limitations,
always keeping the end goal and user needs in focus.

## IV. The Snake Oil Detector: A Comprehensive Toolkit for Leaders Evaluating GenAI Solutions
