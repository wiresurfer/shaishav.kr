# Future of Organizations - Post GenAI Outlook and Trends

A common conversation I have with Startups and Big Corp leaders alike is, how would the world evolve with GenAI. 
These conversations have slightly different trajectories depending on whether the leader is a technical  person or a product/biz person. 
While there is a lot of material out there, I have noticed a BS scale evolving. 

<!-- more -->
- for tech leaders by tech folks  - Low to Medium BS. 
- for tech leaders by non-tech folks  - Shallow, Medium to High BS
- For non-tech leaders by tech leaders - Over promises by Low BS
- For non-tech leaders by non-tech leaders -  BS^infinity

This article is my contribution to the pile of BS already there.  Where I hope to not be as bad a bullshit artist, and drop some truth bombs. 
Ambitious right? lets get on with it then..
