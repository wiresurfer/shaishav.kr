# Business of Datacenters - an India perspective

A few months ago I had a word with my friend Kumar Aakash about our views on
AI's future, specially in the context of Indian startup opportunities. One thing
which came up was a lack of any serious specialized AI datacenter infrastructure
at that time. Some of the key challenges we noted were

-   GPU/TPU datacentres and the high tarrif to even import these.
-   Infererence datacentres too end up going to Mumbai or Chennai across the
    indian internet backbone.
-   Its hard to control where new startups host their AI services. Controlling
    data leaving India is hard.

Cut to last month, another friend of mine called me with an inquiry. He was
approached by folks to invest in a Datacenter business. Their model was
peculiar. They were selling fractional units of the datacenter in 1TB
increments. You invested an amount of Rs X for 1TB of capacity which was leased
to you for a persiod of 10 years as a depereciating asset. The datacentre folks
would then turn around and rent out this capacity and return the investor a
monthly rental revenue.

I digress as this blog isn't gonna cover the novelty/loopholes in the per TB
datacenter business. Thats another can of worms which we will open some other
day in an errata.

Today I wanted to ask a first principles question which has been bothering me
for a while.
