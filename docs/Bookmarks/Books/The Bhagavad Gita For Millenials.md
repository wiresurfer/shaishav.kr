A vyadha is a hunter and is not a brahmana, kshatriya, vaishya or shudra. You have heard about Ekalavya, Nala from the Nala and Damayanti story, and Guha who was King Dasharatha’s friend in the Ramayana. Ekalavya, Nala and Guha were nishadas. Nishadas are not brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas or shudras. Dharmashastra texts (like Manu Samhita) mention several other varnas, other than these four. — location: [1000](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08M9RZXTP&location=1000) ^ref-28117

The Mahabharata has a story about a sage named Kaushika who had taken a vow of always speaking the truth. Once, he was meditating in the forest. Along came some travellers, hotly pursued by bandits. There was a fork in the path, precisely at the spot where he was seated, meditating. The travellers requested Kaushika not to tell the bandits which branch they had taken. Having taken a vow of speaking only the truth, Kaushika would do no such thing. He told the bandits the truth. The bandits fell upon the travellers and killed them. Consequently, Kaushika was punished by being sent to hell. There are other instances in the Mahabharata where lying served a greater common good. — location: [1105](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B08M9RZXTP&location=1105) ^ref-43102
