## Apache Superset | Hacker News

Had a very good experience with Superset.Superset allowed us to replace Tableau and not looking backTook me a while figure out how to embed it into my app using Superset Embedded SDK.Superset Embedded SDK - "Embedded SDK allows you to embed dashboards from Superset into your own app, using your app's authentication. Embedding is done by inserting an iframe, containing a Superset page, into the host application."https://github.com/apache/superset/tree/master/superset-embe...Superset is based on very high quality and well maintained chart library eCharthttps://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/#chart-type-linesGCommunity Roadmaphttps://github.com/apache/superset/projects?query=is%3AopenHuge respect to Preset.io and its team for contributing to the project and keep it in a great shapehttps://preset.io/blog/Superset source code is very easy to read and understand, and as a result it's possible to implement some advanced caching techniques reduce the load on charts.No BI is perfect.Watching Superset for years gives me confidence the project will work as supposed down the road, and eventually some of its packages can be reusable for all kind of visualizations and data hacking.Our main approach to visualisation is to start with eChart and simple Reactjs wrapping and spin off Superset on subdomain for power users, and later see which one works better. Same look gives a very pleasant experience.
