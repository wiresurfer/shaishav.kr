Getting to Know the Linux Kernel: A Beginner's Guide - Kelsey Steele & Nischala Yelchuri, Microsoft

"Getting to Know the Linux Kernel: A Beginner's Guide" offers a comprehensive overview of the Linux kernel and its open source community. The talk covers the essential aspects of the Linux kernel, including its role as the core component of the Linux operating system, its structure and architecture, and the development process. This presentation will take a closer look at the design of the Linux kernel, including how it is structured, how it can be modified, and how it manages resources. Additionally, attendees will learn about the opportunities to get involved in the Linux kernel community and make contributions, with information on accessing resources such as documentation, mailing lists, bug trackers, and version control systems. The talk will also explore the Linux kernel release cycle and the process for developing, testing, and distributing new versions of the kernel. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the open source nature of the Linux kernel and the community that surrounds it, including how to participate in mailing lists and make meaningful contributions to the development of the kernel. This talk is ideal for those new to the world of Linux or anyone looking to deepen their understanding of the Linux kernel and open source community.

## Introduction to Memory Management in Linux
> [Omnivore](https://omnivore.app/me/https-youtu-be-7-a-onivs-xi-j-8-si-c-zou-f-9-i-2-l-ngd-0-dh-g-18ed925b4fd)  |  [Original](https://youtu.be/7aONIVSXiJ8?si=cZouF9i2LNgd0DhG)

Introduction to Memory Management in Linux - Matt Porter, Konsulko

All modern non-microcontroller CPUs contain a memory management unit and utilize the concept of virtual memory. This presentation will describe the different types of virtual memory spaces and mappings used in the Linux kernel, the cases in which they are useful, how they are implemented in the kernel, and how they differ from user space memory. Concepts such as the hardware memory-management unit (MMU) and translation lookaside buffer (TLB) will be discussed, as well as software concepts like kernel page tables. User space concepts such as growable stacks, memory paging, memory mapping, page faults, exceptions, and other memory-related conditions will be covered as well.

About Matt Porter

Matt Porter is the CTO of Konsulko Group. At Konsulko, he works on design and development of software for the Linux kernel and other FOSS projects. Matt has contributed to a number of Linux related projects over his years of community involvement including the various part of the kernel, Debian, RapidIO, Beagleboard.org, and many others. Matt is currently working on GPGPU and eBPF hacks for Linux. Matt has spoken at previous Embedded Linux Conferences on the topics of userspace drivers, Android, Linux 6502 remote processors, kernel testing, and USB gadget configfs, and IoT frameworks.

Here is another lecture style video similar to the previous one. I'm not sure if these kinda videos are watchable, but they liberate me from the chore of video editing which I can't stand anymore, I really apologize for that! The need of editing the video was probably one of the main reasons that demotivated me from uploading here too often. I'm gonna keep doing these types of videos and see how it goes.

The videos are recorded live at my Twitch channel: https://www.twitch.tv/tsoding
