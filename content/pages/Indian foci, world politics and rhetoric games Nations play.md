# Indian foci, world politics and rhetoric games Nations play

Narratives are everywhere. Corporations use it to sell you goods, country use it to boster their political, economic and international stature.

Have a look at these plots.
The good folks at OECD compile macro economic indicators for various countries meticulously.
Its interesting to note "flattening of the curve" when it comes to developed nations like japan and USA.
While China is tapering off slightly, India has been projected to be on an upwards trajectory, and a steep one at that.

Now this is far from a prophecy, so take what you may, from these pretty pictures.
What we are truly interested in, is the question of
- how narratives are built,
- who controls them,
- how do we recognize facts from narratives.
- why is it important for us to think about narratives being built around *x* **replace x with anything that interests/matters to you**
