Whether online or in person, businesses collect a vast amount of customer purchase information. Running this data through a machine learning algorithm allows businesses to predict consumer purchasing habits, market trends, popular products, and so on, allowing retailers to make informed business decisions based on this predicted information. For instance, ML enables companies to: Make accurate decisions on managing stock Streamline ordering according to market and consumer demand Increase the overall efficiency of the logistical and operational processes Integrate with marketing platforms to directly market products targeted at specific consumers In an online environment, ML can: Analyze user browsing habits Predict user preferences accurately Offer targeted suggestions In a pharmaceutical business that runs drug trials, user behavior analysis can help determine the effectiveness of drugs andÂ predict any anomalies and outliers. In the maritime industry, a logistics company can predict shipping demand by feeding the logistical data such as routes, transported goods, durations, etc. to a machine learning algorithm. Analyzing user behavior is not limited to consumers. Any entity in this context can be considered users who interact with the business. ML can be used to extract hidden patterns and behaviors that may not be readily visible on the surface, offering businesses a far greater understanding of the overall business processes.
